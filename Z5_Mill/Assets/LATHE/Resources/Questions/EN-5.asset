  _info: 'Why do we only cut half of the face distance while facing a workpiece on
    the lathe? '
  _answers:
  - _info: Because the other half will get machined during our second pass
    _isCorrect: 0
  - _info: Because the workpiece is turning therefore what we cut on one side is
      consequently cut on the other side at the same time
    _isCorrect: 1
  - _info: We must first change the direction of the lathe before cutting the other
      half
